It has been a couple of days since Jack received the package from MetaCoders, he was told that today 5 computers would be delivered to his home.

Jack is having breakfast when he hears a delivery truck pulling up to his driveway and starts walking to the front door. Before the delivery person has a chance to knock Jack opens the door. They great each other, Jack signs for the package and takes it to his office.

Once he finishes his breakfast and before he starts to open the boxes he notifies HQ that the shipment has arrived and he clocks in. He proceeds to unpack everything from the boxes and only keeps the computers and the chargers on his bookshelf. Jack remembers that the email he received last week telling him about today's shipment had a couple of links that he was supposed to click on once the had the computers. He brings over his laptop and opens that email.

The first link takes him to a spreadsheet. He reads the instructions and starts to fill the spreadsheet with the information about each computer. Once he is done he opens the second link that opens a website with all the steps he needs to follow in order to get the computers ready for the classes.

After a little bit over an hour, Jack finished setting up 4 out of the 5 computers. Something happened with one of the computers mid-way and it didn't pass the final test. He informs HQ that 4 out of the 5 computers are ready, describes the details of what happened to the 5th computer, and he clocks out.

In the afternoon, Jack got home from running some errands and noticed a couple of boxes in his front door. Once he got settled he notified HQ that some packages had arrived and clocked in. He started opening the boxes, they contained power strips, extension cords, and some bins. Jack opened the email that had the instructions on what to do with the contents of these other packages and followed those steps. He finally made room for all these things in his bookshelf and clocked out via Slack.

In the morning, Jack received an email from HQ with some troubleshoot tips on how to fix that 5th computer. He had some plans in the afternoon so he waited until the evening to troubleshoot. Once he got settled he clocked in and started reading the email. Jack started working on the computer and after a few minutes he discovered the bug, it turns out that the bug was a simple typo in the name of a folder. He renamed that folder, ran the proper tests and they all passed! He notified HQ of the good news and clocked out.
