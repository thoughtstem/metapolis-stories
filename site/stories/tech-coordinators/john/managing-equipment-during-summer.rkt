Early Monday morning John gets ready, clocks in, and heads over to Babbage University. He follows the map that was sent to him and heads over to the unloading zone. Ruby is already there waiting to help him. They both unload the car and then Ruby takes the equipment to the room while John parks at the designated parking lot.

John gets back to the room and pulls out the blueprint map that MetaCoders sent him. This map sketches out the overall layout that each location should have, the sections include:

The Work Area: this is where the students will be working with computers in groups
The Play Area: this is where the students and staff will play social games or have snack breaks
The Market Area: this is where all the prizes will be laid out for students to know what they can buy later on
The Stuff Corner: this is where all the student's belongings will be placed in the morning
The Equipment Corner: this is where all the supplies will be kept
John asks a couple of volunteers to help him set The Work Area. Each table will have 5 computers each plugged into a power strip that will be plugged into a wall socket. Ruby asks the rest of the volunteers to help her create the student nametags and get their stations ready with the appropriate curriculum. Once everything is set, John makes sure there aren't any tripping hazards, he tells Ruby what remains in the Equipment Corner, and finally, he makes sure that all the volunteers know where each area, or corner, is located and what activities will occur there.

Before he leaves, John takes a couple of pictures of the setup and sends them to HQ so they can create a guide of how to set up the room in the future.

On Wednesday afternoon, John schedules a time to go check up on the equipment. Ruby informed him that on Tuesday one of the computers was acting up, luckily John had left more computers than needed so Ruby had an extra one to use. John got in touch with HQ and they sent him some instructions on how to fix that computer. Once he was done, he walked around the room making sure everything was still there, and that it was organized properly.

He noticed that some of the computers that were put away were not turned off properly, they were in sleep mode. John told Ruby to make sure that the computers were shut down all the way at the end of every day. She made a note to herself to tell the volunteers at the end of the day. John left for the day, and will probably return Monday morning before the other week starts.
