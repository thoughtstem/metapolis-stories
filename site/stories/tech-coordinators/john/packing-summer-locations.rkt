John was just informed that MetaCoders will host 3 weeks of Summer camps at Babbage University. HQ send him an email with details about shipments, equipment prep, and the hours he's expected to work during those 3 weeks.

A Summer camp is a perfect opportunity for MetaCoders to reach out to students that are usually busy during the school year. Most parents are still working during Summertime and they want their kids to enjoy their break but also to have some fun and learn something. MetaCoders works yearlong to create a schedule with a perfect balance of fun and learning.

John has been the TC for only a couple of schools so he doesn't have enough computers nor equipment for Summer camps -- usually, camps have a maximum capacity of 25 students, but they average out at about 15. The first shipment he receives is from MetaCoders and it contains more Coach-Kits, teaching materials, and office supplies.

A couple of days later, John receives a big shipment of computers. He knows that 6/9/2020 is the deadline for all the equipment to be ready for camp. Therefore, John schedules out his days to make sure everything is complete by then. Throughout the week, he continues to receive camp materials, and he prepares them accordingly.

After a week, John has all the equipment at his place and he's fully prepared and ready to go!
