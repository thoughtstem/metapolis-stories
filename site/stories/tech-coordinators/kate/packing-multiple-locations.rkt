Kate woke up on a Thursday and double-checks her schedule to make sure what classes are running. She confirms that, like every Thursday for the past month, she has to pack for Lovelace Elementary and Hopper Library.

She has a total of 20 computers all charged up. The class at Lovelace has 6 students and the class at Hopper has 8, to simplify it Kate will pack up the equipment for both locations since they have to be ready roughly at the same time frame.

It has been around a month since these classes started therefore packing does not take too long. Kate clocks in and starts packing for Lovelace first. She finishes packing all the equipment needed for the 6 students at Lovelace and then continues to pack for the 8 students at Hopper. Both carts are ready for pick up and now she just has to wait for the Coaches.

Bruce arrives first, he confirms that all the equipment he needs is there and heads over to Lovelace. Sometime later Joseph arrives, while checking the equipment he notices that there are only 5 mice packed in the cart and asks Kate for 3 more -- all the students like to use a mouse at Hopper. Kate realizes she miscounted and brings 3 more mice from her garage. Everything else that Joseph needs is there, so he heads over to Hopper.

After a few minutes, Bruce notifies Kate that he's on his way. Kate waits until the drop-off window starts and clocks in. Bruce gets there and informs Kate that during class they used up all the scrap paper in the coaching kit, and some whiteboard markers have dried up. Everything else in the cart looks good so Bruce clocks out and heads out. Kate takes everything back to her garage, she unpacks everything, plugs in the computers, refills the coach kit with more paper, and sends HQ a request for more whiteboard markers.

About an hour passes and Kate receives a notification that Joseph is on his way. He arrives at Kate's house and double-checks that all the equipment is there, it is so Joseph heads out. Kate takes care of that equipment and after a while, all the computers are charged up so she clocks out.
