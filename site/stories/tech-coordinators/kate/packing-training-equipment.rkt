Kate received an email from HQ informing her that Bruce will be picking up equipment for training today. She remembered that she's done this several times before for Joseph; when he first started and then around a month after that when he needed to review the new material.

The email says that Bruce will be available between 12:00 pm and 3:00 pm. Kate communicates with Bruce via Slack and informs him that he can pick up the equipment at 12:30 pm, Bruce confirms this time. At around 12:15 pm, Kate clocks in and gets the equipment ready for the training. He waits for Bruce to pick it up and clocks out.

Bruce tells Kate that he'll be at the library training and it should take him around 2 hours. The confirm the drop-off at 3:00 pm. Bruce heads over to the library and Kate clocks out. After a couple of hours Bruce messages Kate that he's on his way, Kate confirms that she's home. Bruce drops-off the equipment and clocks out. Kate clocks out once all the equipment is packed away.
