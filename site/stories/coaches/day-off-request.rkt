Outline:

Bruce committed to a class

Opportunity for a family vacation -- needs to miss a meeting

Emails scheduler asking if he can have a sub that one day

Reminded that this is a situation where if he can find his own sub, he is welcome to, but as it is not an emergency, we cannot schedule a sub for him.

Bruce emails Joseph and Ruby. Joseph is teaching another class at that time and is unavailable, but Ruby is available and offers to step in.

Bruce updates the scheduler and takes a wonderful vaca with his family!
