Outline:

Ruby starts feeling ill Monday night
She sends his monitor a quick email letting them know, and that she will update them tomorrow
She wakes up with the flu! oh no!
Updates her monitor, and the scheduler and CC's the HR manager just in case
they tell her to rest up and feel better soon and to keep them in the loop so they know if they need to sub in any other classes.
