 In two days, Bruce's very first class is starting up! He will be coaching an after school program for K-2nd graders at Lovelace Elementary School. Bruce is excited, but also nervous!

 Bruce receives an email from Meta Coders with the subject "Your Lovelace Elementary Class!". Upon opening it, he sees there is a lot of information and, at first, it only increases his nerves. But as Bruce reads the email, he sees answers to a lot of the questions he had -- and several questions he didn't think to have! It tells him:

 @ul[
   @li{Where he should pick up equipment and when}
   @li{Where he should park}
   @li{What classroom he is in}
   @li{How many students are in the class}
   @li{Where he should go when he arrives}
   @li{How students will get to and leave class}
   @li{...it even includes a map of the school with important locations marked on it and the class roster with all student information!}]

 Armed with new information on what to expect at Lovelace Elementary, Bruce feels calmer and ready for his first class day!
