@heading{Thursday, 1:40 pm -- 20 minutes until class start time.}

Bruce rolls his equipment down to room 19 -- he sees there is a class going on in that room,
 so he decides to take the equipment with him over to the 1st of the 2 rooms where he needs
 to pick up Kindergarteners -- K5. He has a few minutes before the Kinder students are released,
 according to the email. Bruce takes out a couple computers and gets them set up with the
 Ratchet GUI while he waits!

@heading{1:45pm -- 15 minutes until class start time.}
Just as promised, the K5 Kindergarten teacher starts lining up his students for dismissal.
 Bruce introduces himself as a coach for an after school program, here to pick up Efan Farrell
 and Aurelia Todd. The teacher calls both students up; he also tells Bruce that all the
 Kindergarten teachers bring their students to the South Gate for dismissal and it might be
 easier/preferable to pick up the students there in the future. Bruce thanks the teacher for
 the tip.

Bruce introduces himself to Efan and Aurelia (he has a feeling he will be saying variations of
 "I'm Bruce, a coach from Meta Coders" a lot!) and keeps the conversation going with the two
 students as he walks with them to room K1. Bruce remembers from training that class starts the
 moment he has 1 student -- so even though he is on the move, he keep the students engaged. The
 K1 teacher is already on their way to the South Gate, so Bruce walks with her as he introduces
 himself again and asks for Benjamin Gallagher. The teacher informs Bruce that Ben was absent
 from school today. Bruce takes Efan and Aurelia back to room 19.

@heading{1:55pm -- 5 minutes until class start time.}
Bruce, Efan and Aurelia arrive back at room 19 just as the school bell rings. The classroom is
 empty except for 1 student -- who turn out to be 1 of Bruce's remaining 3 students, Colin
 Pearson. Bruce knows he needs a few more minutes to set up the last few computers and check
 out the room, so he instructs the students to sit at one of the tables and have a quick snack
 if they need.

Bruce sends a quick slack update on attendance, noting that Ben's teacher told him that Ben was
 absent at school today. He also checks his class roster for the name of the 2 students he is
 waiting on -- Bai Zhou and Ava Cortez. He asks the other students if they know Bai or Ava, and
 if they saw her in school today; Colin answers that Ava is in his class and she was in school
 today. Bruce updates slack with this info.

Bruce pokes his head out the door to see if there are any students that might be Ava or Bai
 nearby. He catches Bai as he is walking up to the class. He gets him settled with the rest of
 the class, and updates slack that Bai is here!

Bruce continues setting up the last of the computers. He also decides where in the room would
 be best to put his students and does some minor adjusting to fit all 5 students at one table
 by the white board. He keeps an eye on the students while he does all this, reminding Efan to
 please go back to the table when he starts wandering around the room, and asking some questions
 about their school day when their conversation goes quiet.

@heading{2:00pm -- class start time}
Bruce is finishing up on the last computer, and asks the students to finish up their snack and
 put their belongings away by the door. Still no sign of Ava, so Bruce messages the slack again
 with that info. Nina responds, saying she will call the parent in five minutes, but points out
 the note that Ava does go the school's general after school program, provided by the Y, so she
 may be there. Bruce makes sure the volume on his phone is up so he will hear any incoming
 messages, then gets ready to continue with class!
