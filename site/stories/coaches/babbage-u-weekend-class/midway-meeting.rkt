       2nd stop in Chapter 1: Welcome quest

       
Outline:

Location intro -- longest running program/location

Coach intro -- who, how long a coach, other details

Leads into what level of Class Map construction coach is on (choosing from preset maps)

Use Class Launch example map

Coach is great an guiding students through the 2 mode of the Class Map model...

Intro Story mode
 - one point of focus (coach, student)
 - can look a lot of different ways
 - lower risk/challenge for most students
 - lower activity level

 Intro Game Mode
 - goal-oriented
 - different students/srudent groups can have different goals
 - multiple points of focus
 - usually where coding takes place
 - can be higher challenge/risk for students

 Similarities in modes?
 - coach always engaged, managing space
 - students always engaged
 - learning

Science behind these two modes...
