This package will contain essential materials that the Coaches will need to teach their classes. This package, amongst other things, will contain the MetaCoders Coach Kit, the MetaCoders Tactics Manual, the MetaCoders Challenge Cards, mice, and other office supplies.<br /><br />Jack is a new TC and he just received his first package. Before he opens the box he notifies HQ via Slack that he received his package and clocks in. He starts cross-checking the contents of the box with the inventory list that was emailed to him to make sure nothing is missing.<br /><br />He proceeds to clear a bookshelf that wasn't really being used and places all the contents on the box there. Jack is done with his first shipment, he notifies HQ that nothing is missing and he clocks out.<br /></div></div><script src="/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js"></script><script src="/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
