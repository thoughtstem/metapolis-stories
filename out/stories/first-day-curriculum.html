Once circled up, Bruce introduces himself (again!) and launches into his Introductory Story that he practiced in training:<br /><br /><blockquote style="color:gray;" class="blockquote">Hello everyone! My name is Bruce and I am your Coding Coach. I am brand new to being a Code Coach and I only started coding a few months ago! I bet some of you have been coding longer than that -- was anyone part of this class in the Winter? Yu? and Efan! Well that means you two have been coders longer than I have!</blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote style="color:gray;" class="blockquote"> I always thought coding was cool -- I love to play video games. Does anyone else like video games? Yes! I love video games and always wanted to make my own, but thought it was really really hard. So I never even tried! Then, when my friend Ruby told me about how she became a Coding Coach and learned how to code with students like you, I thought I would give it a try! </blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote style="color:gray;" class="blockquote">I have been learning just like you ! I have made a lot of mistakes and had a hard time getting all the parentheses right (we will learn about those in a bit!) but I am glad I have been sticking with it because now I get to meet all of you and work with you!</blockquote><br /><br /><img src="https://github.com/thoughtstem/TS-HomeSite/wiki/img/day-1-sine-wave.png" /><br /></div></div><script src="/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js"></script><script src="/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
